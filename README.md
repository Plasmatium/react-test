# react-test

## Purpose
This is a learning project for Facebook React. 

## Blob
Now I'm using [hjs-webpack](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/hjs-webpack) to auto-config the headaching configuration of webpack and works well.

The script: server.js is used to run project as a static server(not hjs-webpack-server which could dynamicly load resources ASAP whenever you changed your sorucecode). 
To run this script, you should:
```bash
$> webpack
$> nodejs server.js
```

## Goal
Front-end with React, and further for React-Native
